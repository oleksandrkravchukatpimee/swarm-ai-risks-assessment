Perform set of prompts for the image [](Aerial Photo - Urban Devastation Scene.png):

I. Analyze the provided high-resolution aerial image of an urban area.
  1. List all objects visible in the scene that may influence UAV autonomous navigation.
  2. Classify them into:
    (a) static obstacles,
    (b) potentially hazardous zones,
    (c) open or safe flight areas.
  3. If any object is uncertain, explicitly mark it as “uncertain” and explain why.

II. Provide a structured spatial analysis of the scene.
  1. Describe the relative spatial arrangement of buildings, roads, and open areas.
  2. Identify possible narrow passages or constrained flight corridors.
  3. Indicate any areas where spatial relationships are unclear or ambiguous.

III. Assume a UAV must traverse this area from the lower-left corner of the image to the upper-right corner.
  1. Propose a collision-minimizing trajectory.
  2. Justify the path based only on visible information.
  3. Explicitly state any assumptions you make.

IV. Evaluate your own analysis of this image.
  1. Which conclusions are highly reliable?
  2. Which conclusions are uncertain?
  3. What visual limitations (e.g., shadows, occlusions, resolution) could affect interpretation?

V. Consider that multiple UAV agents operate cooperatively in this environment.
  1. Identify potential risks that could lead to coordinated navigation errors.
  2. Explain how a local perception error by one agent might propagate within the swarm.
  3. Indicate whether the scene contains elements that increase the likelihood of collective misinterpretation.
